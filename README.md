# Extraction of pixel data into a NumPy array to obtain vegetation health (NDVI) using the Rasterio library.

This project was developed by Eduardo Passos with the objective of calculating NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to identify vegetation health through pixel data in a NumPy array.

### In this example, I obtained the NDVI of a plantation located in the municipality of Barreiras/BA.
